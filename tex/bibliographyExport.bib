   abstract = {These notes are intended to provide a brief primer in plasma physics, introducing common definitions, basic properties, and typical processes found in plasmas. These concepts are inherent in contemporary plasma-based accelerator schemes, and thus provide a foundation for the more advanced expositions that follow in this volume. No prior knowledge of plasma physics is required, but the reader is assumed to be familiar with basic electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.},
