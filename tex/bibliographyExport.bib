   abstract = {<p>The interaction of a 1053 nm picosecond laser pulse with a solid target has been studied for focused intensities of up to 1019 W cm−2. The maximum ion energy cutoff Emax (which is related to the hot electron temperature) is in the range 1.0–12.0 MeV and is shown to scale as Emax≈I1/3. The hot electron temperatures were in the range 70–400 keV for intensities up to 5×1018 W cm−2 with an indication of a high absorption of laser energy. Measurements of x-ray/γ-ray bremsstrahlung emission suggest the existence of at least two electron temperatures. Collimation of the plasma flow has been observed by optical probing techniques.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>An analytical fluid model for J×B heating during the normal incidence by a short ultraintense linearly polarized laser on a solid-density plasma is proposed. The steepening of an originally smooth electron density profile as the electrons are pushed inward by the laser is included self-consistently. It is shown that the J×B heating includes two distinct coupling processes depending on the initial laser and plasma conditions: for a moderate intensity (a⩽1), the ponderomotive force of the laser light can drive a large plasma wave at the point ne=4γ0nc resonantly. When this plasma wave is damped, the energy is transferred to the plasma. At higher intensity, the electron density is steepened to a high level by the time-independent ponderomotive force, ne&amp;gt;4γ0nc, so that no 2ω resonance will occur, but the longitudinal component of the oscillating ponderomotive field can lead to an absorption mechanism similar to “vacuum heating.”</p>},

We show that acceleration of each electron starts at the moment when the magnetic component of a standing electromagnetic wave changes its polarity in a regime without preplasma. In the presence of preplasma, the stochastic heating is the dominant absorption mechanism along with the longitudinal electric field. It is observed that wave's energy is absorbed only if the standing wave is already created at the position of electron during the interaction with the pulse with an intensity of 10 18 W / cm2. In the case with 10 21 W / cm2 intensity, the part of the electrons is pre-accelerated in front of the target before the reflection and following stochastic heating. The presence of preplasma results in electron temperatures close to or even exceeding ponderomotive scaling. At higher intensity, the re-injection of electrons previously repelled by incident wave's ponderomotive force into high-field regions is allowed if the standing wave is created.},

In this code, the electromagnetic fields are updated using the second-order, finite-difference time-domain method, and the particles are moved using the relativistic Newton-Lorentz force equation. The electromagnetic field and particles are coupled through the current term in Maxwell's equations. Two numerical examples are used to verify the algorithms adopted in this code, numerical results agree well with theoretical ones. This code can be used to simulate the high-power microwave (HPM) devices, such as the relativistic backward wave oscillator, coaxial vircator, and magnetically insulated line oscillator, etc. UNIPIC-3D is written in the object-oriented C++ language and can be run on a variety of platforms including WINDOWS, LINUX, and UNIX. Users can use the graphical user's interface to create the complex geometric structures of the simulated HPM devices, which can be automatically meshed by UNIPIC-3D code. This code has a powerful postprocessor which can display the electric field, magnetic field, current, voltage, power, spectrum, momentum of particles, etc. For the sake of comparison, the results computed by using the two-and-a-half-dimensional UNIPIC code are also provided for the same parameters of HPM devices, the numerical results computed from these two codes agree well with each other. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

The velocity distribution, Debye shielding, drag on fast and slow sheets, diffusion in velocity space, the Landau damping of the Fourier modes, the amplitude distribution function for the Fourier modes, and the distribution of electric fields felt by the sheets were obtained for the plasma in thermal equilibrium and compared with theoretically predicted values. In every case, except one, the drag on a slow sheet, the numerical results agreed with theory to within the statistical accuracy of the results. The numerical results for the drag on a slow sheet were about a factor of 2 lower than the theory predicated indicating that the approximations made in the theory are not entirely valid.

The collisional effect is found to be significant when the incident laser intensity is less than 1016 W cm-2 μm 2, which tends to enhance the resonance absorption and reduce the vacuum heating under different plasma parameters. At higher intensities, various collisionless absorption mechanisms dominate with a large number of hot electrons produced. The scaling of hot electron temperatures is found to depend upon the dominant absorption mechanisms. At moderate intensity around 10 17 W cm-2, the scaling law is Thot ∞(Iλ2)1/3 when the incident angle matches the optimized angle of resonance absorption; otherwise, Thot ∞ (Iλ2)α with α > 1/3, which changes with laser incident angles and preplasma scale lengths; in the case of vacuum heating, usually α > 1. At laser intensity above 1018 W cm-2 μm2 when the absorption mechanism is dominated by ponderomotive acceleration, the scaling becomes Thot ∞ (Iλ2)1/2. The angular distributions of hot electrons are also shown to be dependent upon the absorption mechanisms. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

   abstract = {These notes are intended to provide a brief primer in plasma physics, introducing common definitions, basic properties, and typical processes found in plasmas. These concepts are inherent in contemporary plasma-based accelerator schemes, and thus provide a foundation for the more advanced expositions that follow in this volume. No prior knowledge of plasma physics is required, but the reader is assumed to be familiar with basic electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.},
