\chapter{Hot electron temperature models}
In this chapter, we will talk about the models suitable for hot electron temperature modelling. It was already hinted in the first chapter that there are many physical processes contributing to the absorption of laser. As a consequence, there is a non-linear relationship between the initial parameters and the hot electron temperature. It would be very difficult to propose an analytical model where the temperature is explicitly dependant on all the initial parameters. There have been works studying how the temperature scales with respect to intensity \cite{kluge2011,cui2013,miller2023, haines2009, beg1997}, angle \cite{cui2013} or length scale and even pulse durations \cite{miller2023} but none of them model all parameters
